# Java Concurrency Patterns and Features

Concurrency Patterns and features found in Java, through multithreaded programming. 

## Features:
* Threads and Runnables
* Locks
  *	Intrinsic
  *	Explicit
	* Reentrant
	* ReadWrite 
* Synchronizers
  *	Latches
  *	Semaphores
  *	Barriers
* Synchronized Collections
* Concurrent Collections  
  * CopyOnWriteArrayList
  *	ConcurrentHashMap
  *	Blocking Queue
* Executors
  *	Fixed Thread Pool
  *	Cached Thread Pool
  *	Single Thread Pool
  *	Scheduled Thread Pool
* Atomics
* Futures
  * FutureTask
  * CompletableFuture
* Java Memory Model

## Patterns
* Protect Shared State
* Lock Split
* Protecting Composed Actions
* Fixed Lock Ordering
* Thread Local Confinement
* Immutable Object
* Safe Instantiation 
* Safe Publication
* Interruption
* Resource Pool
* Condition Queues (wait-notify / await-signal)
* Background Task Executor
* Task Cancel
* Producer-Consumer
* Task Convergence
* Non-Blocking with Atomics
* Controlled Concurrent Initialization
